## UCSC Xena Datasets

[UCSC Xena platform](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/) is developed by the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute and serves as a comprehensive repository to provide thousands of processed omics datasets from large cancer research projects (e.g. TCGA, PCAWG and CCLE) or individual research groups and enable unprecedented research opportunities. 

The hierarchy for storing and querying datasets is as follows:

- The UCSC Xena repository is generally comprised of **11** data hubs from various portals;
- Each data hub could include many sample cohorts;
- Each sample cohort could involve multiple omics profiling or phenotype data;
- Each omics profiling could have several datasets due to normalization methods or other factors.

```




> Note: In the UCSCXenaShiny, we summarized all the data (sub)types into four main types, referring to *clinicalMatrix*, *genomicsMatrix*, *genomicSegment*, *mutationVector*, where the genomicsMatrix is the key component.


```{r p0202, fig.cap='The main types and subtypes of datasets',  fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}

```


The following figure shows the numbers of cohorts and datasets for each datahub of UCSC Xena.  Although some hubs (like toilHub, pancanAtlasHub) have relatively lower numbers of datasets, they mainly focus of pan-cancer integration, which could be more valuable in some research. Here, we will briefly introduce these hubs for better use.
