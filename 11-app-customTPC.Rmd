# Custom TPC modules

1. Each custom module can perform one specific TPC (**T**CGA, **P**CAWG, **C**CLE), analysis mainly based on UCSCXenaShiny functions introduced in chapter 6.


```{r p1101, fig.cap='All Custom TPC modules in shiny app',  fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/p1101.png')
```


2. The initial step of most modules usually involves the check and modification of molecular datasets  through the `Modify datasets[opt]` widget.

- As mentioned in chapter 5, we can easily fetch several single molecular data from TPC databases. For some of them, their are alternative datasets for users to select, which greatly enriches the analytical arrange.
- Among the 7 types of TCGA molecules, 4 of them have the alternative datasets. (Figure)

```{r p1102, fig.cap='Alternative datasets of TCGA molecules',  fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/p1102.png')
```


> Tips: For DNA Methylation, mean value of all CpG sites under one gene will be calculated for the gene by default. In the `Modify datasets[opt]` widget, users can furtherly limit its CpG sites and modify the aggregation method (e.g. median).



- Among the 5 types of PCAWG molecules, 2 of them have the alternative datasets. (Figure)
- Among the 4 types of CCLE molecules, 1 of them have the alternative datasets. (Figure)
