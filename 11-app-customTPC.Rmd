# Custom TPC modules {#custom-tpc}

Here, each custom module can perform one specific TPC (**T**CGA, **P**CAWG, **C**CLE) analysis based on the functions introduced in Chapter \@ref(data-analysis).


```{r p1101, fig.cap='All Custom TPC modules in shiny app',  fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/p1101.png')
```


Usually, the initial step of most modules involves the check and modification of molecular datasets through the `Modify datasets[opt]` widget. For some molecular types of TPC databases, there are alternative datasets for users to select, which greatly enriches the analytical possibilities

- Among the 7 types of TCGA molecules, 4 of them have the alternative datasets.

```{r p1102, fig.cap='Alternative datasets of TCGA molecules',  fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/p1102.png')
```


> Tips: For DNA Methylation, mean value of all CpG sites under one gene will be calculated for the gene by default. In the `Modify datasets[opt]` widget, users can furtherly limit its CpG sites and modify the aggregation method (e.g. median).


- Among the 5 types of PCAWG molecules, 2 of them have the alternative datasets.

- Among the 4 types of CCLE molecules, 1 of them has the alternative datasets.
