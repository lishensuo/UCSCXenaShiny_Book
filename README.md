- [**UCSCXenaShiny**](https://github.com/openbiox/UCSCXenaShiny) is an R package for interactively exploring UCSC Xena datasets. It is mainly designed to provide a web app (built on the top of [`{shiny}`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) framework and [`{UCSCXenaTools}`](https://github.com/ropensci/UCSCXenaTools/) package) for downloading, analyzing and visualizing datasets from [UCSC Xena](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/). 
- In the latest version, the application can support both general and personalized  tumor molecular analysis with versatile functional modules and user-friendly interface layouts. Overall, our tool aims to make best use of public omics data from UCSC Xena and assist broad user community with precision oncology research.  
- Here, we have prepared the tutorial book (https://github.com/lishensuo/UCSCXenaShiny_Book.io) to introduce the detailed usage of UCSCXenaShiny based on R Markdown and [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).
