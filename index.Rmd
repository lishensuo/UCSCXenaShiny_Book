# About {-}

**UCSCXenaShiny** is an R package for interactively exploring UCSC Xena datasets. It is mainly designed to provide a web app (built on the top of [`{shiny}`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) framework and [`{UCSCXenaTools}`](https://github.com/ropensci/UCSCXenaTools/) package) for downloading, analyzing and visualizing datasets from [UCSC Xena](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/). In the latest version, the application can support both general and personalized  tumor molecular analysis with versatile functional modules and user-friendly interface layouts. Overall, our tool aims to make best use of public omics data from UCSC Xena and assist broad user community with precision oncology research.  

```{r p0000_1,  fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/p0000_1.png')
```

Here, we have prepared the tutorial book to introduce the detailed usage of UCSCXenaShiny based on R Markdown and [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). Firstly, we will start with the basic knowledge of UCSC Xena repository and its data hubs in **Chapter \@ref(intro)**. Then, the following chapters can be generally divided into two parts for the usage of R package and Shiny App:

#### Part Ⅰ {-} 

- **Chapter \@ref(install)**：The ways to install UCSCXenaShiny package.
- **Chapter \@ref(build-in)**：Avalilable built-in datasets of package, e.g. clinical or survival data.
- **Chapter \@ref(data-query)**：The functions to query molecular data of TPC datasets.
- **Chapter \@ref(data-analysis)**：The functions to perform various analyses based on TPC datasets.

#### Part Ⅱ  {-} 

- **Chapter \@ref(visit)**：The ways to visit UCSCXenaShiny application.
- **Chapter \@ref(home)**：The intuitive widgets and quick exploration modules in homepage.
- **Chapter \@ref(repo)**：The query for all datasets of UCSC Xena repository.
- **Chapter \@ref(general-da)**：General analysis modules for any matrix datasets.
- **Chapter \@ref(custom-tpc)**：Custom analysis modules for TPC datasets.
- **Chapter \@ref(per-tpc-1)**：The key preprocesses of personalized TPC pipelines. 
- **Chapter \@ref(per-tpc-2)**：The versatile analyses of personalized TPC pipelines. 
- **Chapter \@ref(download)**：Two download modules for the custom data subset. 



#### Part Ⅲ {-}
